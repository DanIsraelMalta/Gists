The following functions/examples exist in the repository:

enumerate.h - intuitive enumeration of a list of things

ArrayOfBytes.h - helper object to deal with integral types as array of bytes

irange.h - A flexible range based for loop implementation which allows both looping in reverse order and looping with a given stride

FSM.h - minimal generic finite state machine

LazyStringSplit.h - Lazy string splitting and iteration

EncryptedString.h - compile time encrypted, run time decrypted string

Reactive.h - minimal functional reactive programming kit (in less then 150 lines of code)

zip_iterator.h - parallel-iterate over several controlled heterogeneous sequences simultaneously

async_deferred.h - an emulated 'std::async' with 'deferred' option with the added value that it doesn't block until thread is finished when returned future is destructed

mixin.h - implementing the 'mixin' design pattern without any run-time costs

enumeration_casts.h - a set of utilities to safely handle enumeration<->number casting (with compile time checks)

GenericVisitor.h - A generic visitor (with example usage)

NamedArguments.cpp - An example of how to emulate a function with named arguments in c++

Dictionary.h - compile-time fixed-size bi-directional map (dictionary) for integer types
